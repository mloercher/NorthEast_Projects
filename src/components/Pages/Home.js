                <p>'Passive House' is a building methodology developed to aggressively meet the climate crisis carbon reduction imperative while making a comfortable, healthy and affordable built environment. It calls for drastic cuts in the amount of energy our buildings consume through passive methods (insulation, solar heat gain, etc) - hence the name 'Passive House'. Unlike many other 'green' certifications, the Passive House standard is performance driven, meaning you either pass or fail based on target criteria developed for your specific project. </p>
